									<b>What is Programming?</b><br>
									Computer programming is the process of writing code to facilitate specific actions in a computer,
									application or software program, and instructs them on how to perform.

				<th>Description</th>
				<th>
					It incorporates modules, exceptions, <br>
					dynamic typing, <br>
					very high level dynamic data types, <br>
					and classes. It supports multiple <br>
					programming paradigms beyond <br>
					object-oriented programming, <br>
					such as procedural <br>
					and functional programming.

				<th>
					Java is a widely used object-oriented <br>
					programming language <br>
					and software platform that runs on <br>
					billions of devices, including <br>
					notebook computers, mobile devices, <br>
					gaming consoles, medical <br>
					devices and many others. The rules <br>
					and syntax of Java are based <br>
					on the C and C++ languages.
				</th>
				<th>
					The C programming language <br>
					is a procedural and general-<br>
					purpose language that <br>
					provides low-level access <br>
					to system memory.
				</th>
				<th>
					C++ is a cross-platform language <br>
					that can be used to create high-<br>
					performance applications.<br>
					C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, <br>
					as an extension to the C language.<br>
					C++ gives programmers a high <br>
					level of control over system <br>
					resources and memory.
				</th>
				<th>
					C# (pronounced "See Sharp") <br>
					is a modern, object-oriented, <br>
					and type-safe programming language. <br>
					C# enables developers to build<br>
					 many types of secure and <br>
					 robust applications that run <br>
					 in .NET. C# has its roots in <br>
					 the C family of languages and<br>
					  will be immediately familiar <br>
					  to C, C++, Java, and <br>
					  JavaScript programmers.

				<th>It is Used for</th>
				<th> 
					Python is commonly used for <br>
					developing websites and software, <br>
					task automation, data analysis, <br>
					and data visualization. Since it's <br>
					relatively easy to learn, <br>
					Python has been adopted by many <br>
					non-programmers such as <br>
					accountants and scientists, <br>
					for a variety of everyday tasks, <br>
					like organizing finances.
				</th>

				<th>
					Developers use Java to construct <br>
					applications in laptops, data <br>
					centres, game consoles, scientific <br>
					supercomputers, cell phones,<br>
					 and other devices. 
				</th>

				<th>
					C is commonly used on computer <br>
					architectures that range from <br>
					the largest supercomputers to <br>
					the smallest microcontrollers<br>
					 and embedded systems.
				</th>

				<th>
					C++ is used in developing browsers, <br>
					operating systems, and applications,<br>
					 as well as in-game programming, <br>
					 software engineering, data <br>
					 structures, etc.
				</th>

				<th>
					C# can be used to create a number <br>
					of different programs and <br>
					applications: mobile apps, desktop <br>
					apps, cloud-based services, <br>
					websites, enterprise software <br>
					and games. Lots and lots of games.
